# CS787 GenAI Project on :  Dual-Decoder-Implementation-for-English-requirements-to-STL-Translation

System requirements are usually written in English because it is easy for humans to read and understand
stand. However, computers and verification tools need these requirements in a formal and precise way
to check if a system behaves correctly. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is one such formal language that
can express time-based and logical conditions for system signals. Translating English requirements into
STL helps connect what engineers describe in plain language with what automated tools can verify.
This translation supports better safety checks, system validation, and reliable design.
